# JWTREST

Basic RESTful server with JWT authentication built in Java using Spring

## Endpoints:

### Signup:
Allows a user to signup simply by sending a post request with the desired 
username and password in the header. If a user with the given username already 
exists, the server responds with a response code of `400`.

`Method: POST`

`Data:`

### Login:
Allows a user to login to the server by sending a post request with the
username and password. This endpoint will only work once a user has successfully
signed up. Note that because users are stroed in memory, all users are wiped 
upon server restart.
